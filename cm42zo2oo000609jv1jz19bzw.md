### Empowering Indian Farmers Through Technology

**Introduction :**  
Agriculture is the backbone of India, but despite their hard work, farmers often struggle to get fair compensation for their crops. To address this, my team and I participated in the Smart India Hackathon and embarked on building a solution: **Project GenZcrop**. This Android application aims to empower farmers by connecting them directly with consumers, eliminating the middlemen who take hefty commissions.

### **Purpose: Bridging the Gap**

Through our field visits, we discovered critical challenges faced by farmers:

* **Limited Storage Facilities**: Farmers sell crops like rice to mills for as low as ₹28-30 per kilogram, not because they want to but because they lack proper storage or inventory management.
    
* **Lack of Direct Consumer Channels**: There’s no platform for farmers to sell directly to consumers at market rates. For instance, consumers are willing to pay ₹65 per kilogram of rice, but farmers rarely get to benefit from this.
    

Our application aims to solve these issues by enabling farmers to **receive pre-orders** directly from consumers. This ensures farmers have a clear demand pipeline and can plan their harvest accordingly.

Consumers are highly likely to pre-order as they’ll receive regular updates about their crops, including health status and an active timeline of growth. This level of transparency not only builds trust but also ensures consumers feel connected to the source of their food.

Based on a survey, **over 85% of Indian farmers already have access to smartphones**. This widespread accessibility makes an Android app the ideal solution to empower farmers with technology. It enables them to connect directly with consumers, ensuring better profits and bypassing intermediaries.

### **Core Features**

**1\. Dual Application Ecosystem**

* **Farmer App**:
    
    * Farmers can register their crops, update the crop’s growth stage, and track orders.
        
    * They receive notifications about pre-orders and inquiries directly from consumers.
        
* **Consumer App**:
    
    * Consumers can browse through available crops, check the health and progress of crops, and place pre-orders.
        
    * The app provides a timeline feature, allowing consumers to track the development stages of their produce.
        

**2\. Bargaining Section**

* Consumers and farmers can negotiate the price of crops, fostering a transparent and fair trading system.
    
* Similar to an auction model but tailored for both parties to arrive at a win-win deal.

**3\. Crop Timeline & Health Monitoring**

* Farmers can update the growth phase of the crops, providing real-time data to consumers.
    
* This builds consumer confidence as they can see how and when their produce is being cultivated.

**4\. Google Maps API Integration**

* Consumers can locate nearby farmers, browse their available crops, and make purchases locally.

### **Tech Stack**

* **Firebase**: For real-time database management and file storage.
    
* **Google Maps API**: To enable location-based features.
    
* **Razorpay AP**I: For Safe and Seamless transactions.
    
* **Figma**: For UI/UX design and prototyping.
    
* **Android Studio (Java & Kotlin)**: For app development.
    

### **Potential Business Model**

Project GenZcrop has the potential to scale into a sustainable business by charging a minimal commission per transaction or offering premium features like priority listing, advanced analytics for crop growth, and consumer trends.

### **Screenshots**

Here are some conceptual screenshots that my team and I have developed in Figma to visualize the app:
