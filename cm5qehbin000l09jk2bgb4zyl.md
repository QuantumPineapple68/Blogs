Open source is a realm of infinite learning and collaboration, and diving into it has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my journey so far. As a second-year engineering student in my third semester, I embarked on this incredible adventure, and I’m excited to share the story of my first two contributions to the open-source world.

Both of these contributions mark <mark>my first steps into the open-source world</mark>, and I’m thrilled to share that they were <mark>successfully MERGED!</mark>

## Contribution #1: AnkiDroid – An App with 10M+ Downloads

AnkiDroid, a highly popular flashcard app with over 10 million downloads on the Google Play Store, became the stage for my first open-source contribution. Here's how it unfolded:

### The Process:

1. **Discovering the Issue:** The journey began when I spotted a GitHub issue. I promptly claimed the issue, ready to dive in.
    
2. **Exploring the Codebase:** Forking the repository revealed a massive codebase. At first, it felt overwhelming, like navigating an ocean of complexity.
    
3. **Understanding and Collaborating:** After thoroughly exploring the code, I initiated discussions with David Allison, a maintainer at AnkiDroid. His guidance was instrumental in shaping my understanding of the code and the changes required.
    
4. **Joining the Community:** Joining their Discord server introduced me to a community of talented individuals from around the world. Discussions here were invaluable in refining my approach.
    
5. **Creating the Pull Request:** With all the knowledge and feedback I had gathered, I created my first-ever Pull Request. Seeing it get merged was an indescribable moment of pride and joy!
    

**The change might have been small, but the experience taught me invaluable lessons about collaboration, attention to detail, and the open-source process.**

## Contribution #2: Wikimedia Commons App

Continuing my open-source journey, my next stop was the Wikimedia Commons Android app—a non-profit, open-source app for uploading photos to Wikimedia Commons.

### The Process:

1. **Taking Initiative:** I came across a UI issue reported on GitHub. Nicolas Raoul, the maintainer, assigned the issue to me, and I got started immediately.
    
2. **Problem Solving:** After analyzing the problem, I identified that the login screen elements needed better alignment for both portrait and landscape modes.
    
3. **Implementation:** I updated the layout parameters in the XML files, ensuring the login frame appeared centered across all screen sizes and orientations.
    
4. **Team Support:** Throughout the process, I had incredible support from Josephine Lim, who guided me through the review process, and Sujal Gupta, who provided valuable suggestions.
    
5. **Verification:** I rigorously tested the app on multiple devices to ensure the changes worked seamlessly.
    

### What I Changed:

* Ensured the login frame aligned perfectly in the center, providing an improved user experience.

## Key Learnings

* **Collaboration is Key:** Working with an international team was a highlight of this journey. From David Allison’s mentorship to valuable feedback from Josephine Lim and Sujal Gupta, the collaborative spirit of open source is unparalleled.
    
* **Attention to Detail:** Even small UI changes can have a significant impact on user experience, and this taught me the importance of precision.
    
* **Confidence Boost:** Completing these contributions as a second-year student boosted my confidence immensely. It reassured me that I’m on the right path and capable of tackling bigger challenges.
