## Introduction

After a long time of rigorous development and user feedback, I'm excited to unveil Connectra v1.1 - a significant update that transforms our skill exchange platform. This release isn't just about adding features; it's about creating a more intuitive, engaging, and user-friendly experience that addresses real-world communication challenges.

## The Evolution of Communication: Inbox Redesign

### Instagram-Inspired Messaging Preview

Drawing inspiration from modern social platforms, we've reimagined the messaging interface. Users can now see message previews reminiscent of Instagram's inbox, providing:

* Instant message context
    
* Timestamp of last interaction
    
* Visual cues for unread messages
    

The goal? Making communication more immediate and contextual.

## Enhanced Messaging Interactions

### React and Respond

Borrowing from WhatsApp and Instagram's playbook, users can now react to messages. This feature transforms static text exchanges into more dynamic, expressive conversations. Whether it's a thumbs-up, heart, or laugh, reactions add nuance to digital communication.

### Emoji Visualization

We've implemented a game-changing visual enhancement: emojis now appear larger when they're the sole content of a message. This creates more engaging and visually appealing communication, making emotional expression more impactful.

## Profile Transparency: Self-Rating System

Users can now view their comprehensive rating profile, including:

* Total number of ratings received
    
* Aggregate rating score
    
* Breakdown of individual ratings
    

This transparency builds trust and helps users showcase their credibility within the Connectra ecosystem.

## Media Interaction Improvements

### Enhanced Image Handling

We've introduced three critical improvements to media interactions:

1. **Full-Screen Certificate Viewing**
    
    * Users can now expand certificates to full-screen
        
    * Provides detailed examination of professional credentials
        
2. **Zoomable Profile Elements**
    
    * Both profile pictures and certificates are now zoomable
        
    * Allows precise inspection of visual details
        
3. **Circular Profile Picture Cropping**
    
    * Integrated a convenient cropping mechanism
        
    * Ensures profile pictures fit perfectly in circular holders
        
    * Eliminates awkward image positioning

## Storage Optimization

Recognizing Firebase's free-tier limitations, we've implemented a 2MB per-image size restriction. This strategic decision ensures:

* Optimal storage utilization
    
* Faster upload speeds
    
* Compliance with Firebase's 5GB storage limit
    

## Performance Enhancements

### Swipe-to-Refresh Profiles

Introducing a SwipeRefreshLayout for profile reloading:

* Intuitive gesture-based data refresh
    
* Immediate profile data retrieval
    
* Improved user experience through responsive design

## Chat Interface Refinement

Inspired by Instagram's messaging layout, we've redesigned the chat interface:

* Constrained message width for better readability
    
* More aesthetically pleasing conversation view
    
* Improved text legibility
    

## Detonator Update

The detonator has been updated to read the value of its own version from Firebase that is, isActive\_1,1 which is true by default. Now we have 2 detonators in the Admin panel of Connectra.

<mark>The Detonator of v1.0 will be turned off soon, to force all users to update to v1.1</mark>

* Addressed reported crashes
    
* Optimized performance
    
* Enhanced overall system stability
